        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>I am the second son among my three other siblings, of which Akosuah is the youngest. <br> Our parents trained us to live and grow as a team, with the understanding that we need to be there for each other always. <br> I was born in Accra, which is in Ghana and completed all my studies here, from basic school through to tertiary. <br> My concern about Ghana's poor environmental management and sanitation led me to study environmental and safety Engineering at the tertiary level.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Joining AltSchool</h1>     
        <p>Having worked as a plant technician at a mining site, I observed the need to incorporate current advanced computational technological systems to my skill set to better achieve my goals. <br> This desire made me start looking for the means and channels to acquire these necessary skill sets, and boom! I found AltSchool Africa, and I have joined an engineering program.</p>
        <p>My main goal for joining this program is to be able to join in the creating or running of modernised technological applications or infrastructures directed towards environmental management and engineering.</p>
